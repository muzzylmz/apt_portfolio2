 		<h2> Utilities</h2>
	</div>
		<button class="accordion">* Q:  What utilities are included in the price of the rent?</button>
		<div class="panel">
		<p>** A:  Heating, water (cold and hot), and trash/recycle are included in the price of the rent.</p>
	</div>

	<button class="accordion">* Q: What utilities do the tenants have to pay?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>** A:  The tenants pay DTE which covers both the electricity and gas (if applicable), Internet service, and parking.</p>
	</div>

	<button class="accordion">* Q: What internet companies service the building?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>** A:  I've been told that both Comcast and AT&T service the building.  You may be able to find other options through your own research.</p>
</div>


		<h2>Rent</h2>
		<button class="accordion">* Q: What forms of payment are acceptable for rent?</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>** A: We accept checks only.  Some tenants have their bank send a check monthly around the 25th and this seems to work as well.  Ask Clementine for address if you would like to have your bank send a check each month.</p>
	</div>

	<button class="accordion">* Q: Can 3 people live in a 2 bedroom apartment?</button>
	<div class="panel">
			<p>** A:  Yes, but that is the limit for the 2 bedroom apartments.  The 2 bedroom apartments are for 2 people and the addition of an extra tenant in the apartment adds an additional $150 to the monthly rent total and $225 to the deposit.</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">* Q:  How many people can live in the 3 bedroom apartment?</button>
	<div class="panel">
			<p>** A: Up to 5 people can live in the 3 bedroom apartment.  It has very large rooms that will accommodate this quantity of people.  The 3 bedroom apartment is for 3 people and the addition of extra tenants will add an additional $150 per tenant to the monthly total and $225 per extra tenant to the deposit.</p>
</div>

		<h2>Subleasing</h2>
		<button class="accordion">* Q:  Can tenants sublease their rooms/apartment?</button>
	<div class="panel">
			<p>** A:  Yes.  You will want to sign a sublease agreement with your subleasers as you will still be bound by your lease terms until it ends.  Make sure that Ming or Clementine have the subleaser's name and contact information.  Clementine encourages tenants to be responsible when searching for subleasers as a matter of your protection.  You can ask them for an application, references, or even do a basic credit/background check on your own.  If you are considering subleasing, do some research to keep yourself safe and your subleasers knowledgeable.</p>
</div>

	<button class="accordion">* Q:  Will management sublease the apartment for the tenant?</button>
	<div class="panel">
			<p>** A: No, you must find and sign your own subleasers.  All marketing of your apartment must be done through your own efforts.  Sublease templates can be found and downloaded online.  Once you have found subleasers, you are responsible for informing management of the arrangement and sharing the name and contact info of your subleaser.</p>
</div>


		<h2>Parking</h2>
		<button class="accordion">* Q:  How much does parking cost?</button>
	<div class="panel">
			<p>** A: A space in the lot costs $70 per month.  A space underneath the building costs $100 per month.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">* Q:  Can I pay for parking for only half the year?</button>
<div class="panel">
			<p>** A: No, parking spots are leased for the whole year (12 months).</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">* Q:  Someone is parked in my spot, what should I do about it?</button>
<div class="panel">
			<p>A:  There is a towing sign that states this is private property and gives tow company information.  We try not to tow unless we have to because it is usually the friend or family member of someone in the apartment building that is wrongly parked.  However, if parking is tight, and the car is a repeat offender, then the tow company will be called on behalf of the renter of the parking spot.  Management must be told of parking issues and must call tow truck in these situations.<p>
