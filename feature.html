<h4>What tenants like about this apartment:</h4>
<li>Location:  Close to campus, apartment is on 2nd floor of building, overlooking trees and back areas of neighboring houses.</li>
<li>Large space:  This apartment feels much bigger than our regular apartments because it is but also because the kitchen is separate from the living area.  This is the perfect space for a 3 roommate situation (please note, adding a 3rd roommate in 2bd apartment costs extra, see FAQ)</li>
<li>Nice kitchen:  Plenty of cabinet and counter space, dishwasher, electric glass top oven/stove, fridge and garbage disposal</li>
<li>Utilities:  Heat, hot/cold water, building wifi and trash/recycle are all covered by landlord.  Tenants pay DTE for electricity and have the option to get their own internet account for faster, private service.</li>
<br>
<h4>What tenants did not like:</h4>
<li>Close to street:  The apartment sits close to the street and other houses so during some times of the year (football season for example) it may be noisy outside.</li>
<li>Building wifi may not reach the outer edges of the rooms because the apartment it is situated  on the corner of the building opposite from the building router.</li>
